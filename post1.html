  <h1>The Day I Decided to Write</h1>
  <p>Today, I finally opened my laptop and decided to write something — not for marks, not for anyone else, just for myself. Maybe it was the evening light, or the quiet around me, but something felt right,maybe appropraite.
  It would be great if i could take a topic work on it and write blogs here so that you can get an idea how my brain works!</p>

  <p>Writing feels like breathing again — like untangling the knots in my head. I don’t know if I’ll keep it up, but for now, this page feels like home.</p>
